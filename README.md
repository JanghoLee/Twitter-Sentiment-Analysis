Twitter sentiment analysis R code written using bag-of-words analysis methods. This was used for some basic analysis before more complicated machine learning processes were deployed.

The basic guidelines for this code were inspired from http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4839225/twitter%20text%20mining%20with%20R.pdf

The code include herein was used to analyze sentiment on Twitter surrounding the State of the Union. I am currently unable to share many details regarding this project, but some of the barebones are available here.
